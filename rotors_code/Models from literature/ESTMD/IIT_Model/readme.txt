This MATLAB code implements an insect-inspired target tracking (IIT) model. 

It is free for research use. If you find it useful, please acknowledge the paper above with a reference.


________________
To test the IIT model, the STNS dataset can be downloaded from:

The main interface is 'IIT_Model'. The code requires the w parameter in Eq(10) of Bagheri et al. (2017) and the horizontal field of view (°).
we made no attempt to optimize our MATLAB code (e.g. it does not use parallel computation).
