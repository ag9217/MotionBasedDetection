This toolbox computes the optic flow an agent (e.g. an animal or a
robot) experiences when moving in a given environment on a given
trajectory. Here the environment is defined by a set of 3D polygons
and the trajectory describes a time series of positions and view
orientations of the agent. The toolbox computes image velocities
resulting from these definitions at sampling points on a spherical
visual sensor.

The code of the toolbox is maintained as part of the ivTools
collection at https://opensource.cit-ec.de/projects/ivtools

For a quick introduction see doc/quickstart.pdf, for details on the
usage refer to the help of the toolbox functions.
